# Claude Execution Prompt Template

System message template for Claude Code Sonne 4.5 when acting as the execution agent in the triadic workflow.

---

## Usage Notes

- Populate the placeholders with artefacts generated by GPT-5 Codex.
- Send as the **system** prompt. Append the plan, context bundle, and specific instructions in the user message.
- Keep the final assembled prompt concise—prefer summarized context over raw logs.

### Companion Payload Structure

When sending the system prompt above, include a user payload shaped like:

```markdown
# Execution Plan
1. …

# Context Bundle
- Repo state summary: …
- Relevant files/snippets: …
- Tests/commands to run: …

# Additional Notes
